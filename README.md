## CNV_XHMM
#### Ths project is to detect copy numebr variation (CNV) in Whole-Exome Seqeuncing Data. 
#### The current goal is to dealing with the bam files in odre to get the vcf file.

4. Building the resource databases : GTFs from the UCSC table browser were downloaded for hg19, for RefSeq, CCDS and GENCODE transcripts
for example, download the refseq-hg19.gtf.gz from the UCSC Table Brower https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables. <br />
$ pseq . loc-load --file refseq-hg19.gtf.gz --group refseq --locdb locdb <br />
